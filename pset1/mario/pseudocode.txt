For this project mario1:
    1. make a prompt that should take a positive int (1-8) to know how many to print
    2. make a for loop that prints for the number given half a triangle in reverse
    2.5 had to make a for loop+ adding space (then another forloop for #) finish first with new line
    
for mario2:
    1. make a prompt similar to mario.1
    2. make a loop that will mirror with a space the for loop in mario1
